Intent
Separate the user interface into three interconnected components: the model, the view and the controller. Let the model manage the data, the view display the data and the controller mediate updating the data and redrawing the display.

Applicability
Use the Model-View-Controller pattern when

you want to clearly separate the domain data from its user interface representation
