# 01 Linked Lists

Linked Lists are most useful when you have very large lists, where you need to be able to insert or remove elements in arbitrary positions. With normal lists, the entire list is stored in memory contiguously; but linked lists are not stored contiguously so elements can change without the entire remainder of the list having to be re-written.

# 02 Queue

Queue follows the First In First Out(FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.

# 03 Stack

Stack follows the Last In First Out(LIFO) rule - last element arriving comes out first.
