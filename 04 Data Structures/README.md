# 01 Linked Lists

>Linked Lists are most useful when you have very large lists, where you need to be able to insert or remove elements in arbitrary >positions. With normal lists, the entire list is stored in memory contiguously; but linked lists are not stored contiguously so elements >can change without the entire remainder of the list having to be re-written.
